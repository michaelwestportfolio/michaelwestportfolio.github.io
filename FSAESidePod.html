        <p style="text-align: center;"><b>My Contributions:</b><br>
          I led the research and design of a side pod for a Formula SAE car. The purpose of the side pod is to intake air for the radiator, and secondarily other components. I began with a thorough white paper review for research into what other teams have done in the past as well as fluid dynamics principles which went farther than my classes so far. I also examined what my team has done in the past and looked at areas for improvement.
          I created different iterations and versions of a side pod, eventually settling on the design shown above. It is a blend of aerodynamic performance and the necessary "cool factor" for scoring well with the judges. The part was created using Solidworks surfacing techniques. I am currently in the process of manufacturing the side pod from scratch with carbon fiber layups. Computational tools like Fluent and Discovery were used for analyzing the
          wake behind a rolling tire to get an approximation of the flow field entering the intake. From there, a velocity deficit model was applied. The design will be validated using more rigorous and high fidelity simulations.<br>

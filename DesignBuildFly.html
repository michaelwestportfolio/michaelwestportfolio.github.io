        <p style="text-align: center;"><b>My Contributions:</b><br> The above images are of various concepts I modeled throughout the Fall quarter of my Freshman year in university. The upper images are two concepts of ramps to drop the payload (wooden boxes) to the ground without activating the impact sensors attached to the payloads. The lower image is a conveyor belt concept I modeled to load the payload onto the ramp.
          Everything pictured was modeled in Solidworks by me. The two ramp concepts were designed by me, while the conveyor concept was designed collaboratively with another student.
            <br><b>Skills Used:</b><br>
            Solidworks, design, team collaboration</p>

        <p style="text-align: center;"><b>My Contributions:</b><br>
            The objective was to “resto-mod” a 1976 Jaguar XJ6-C starting with a vehicle with no power train. Transplant a modern, OBD-II era Jaguar AJ16 engine into the 1976 recipient. Additionally, restore all other aspects of the recipient vehicle including paint, interior, suspension, etc. This project was heavy on hands-on experience. As pictured above, the restoration was complete leaving no part of the recipient vehicle untouched. Every part of the car restoration process was explored from sanding and body work, to engine calibration, to suspension rebuilding. The electrical aspect of the restoration was particularly long, as the donor vehicle ran off of 12 distinct computers and the recipient car was pared down to 3 computers. This gave me practical experience in comprehending complicated schematics. I completed this project with my father, however every aspect of the restoration was collaborative. I worked with body work, electrical schematics, wiring, wrench-turning (a lot of it!), etc. I worked first hand with every aspect of the car, seeing how internal combustion cars work and how my classwork applies to the real world in the automotive industry.<br>

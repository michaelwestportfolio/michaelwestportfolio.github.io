        <p style="text-align: center;"><b>My Contributions:</b><br>
            <i>1) Muffler Mount Design and Fabrication</i> - I undertook the design of the muffler mounts, ensuring that they could securely hold the muffler in place while meeting space constraints. I then fabricated the muffler mounts out of aluminum tubes by hand, using tools like an angle grinder.<br>
            <i>2) Muffler Heat Shield</i> - Continuing after the muffler was mounted, I designed and fabricated a heat shield. The heat shield was necessary for the safety of the driver, protection of surrounding components from excessive heat, and was also required per the FSAE rules. The heat shield design required working with complicated Solidworks assemblies to ensure there were no conflicts with other parts. I then fabricated the heat shield by hand using a perforated aluminum sheet and trial & error bending techniques.<br>
            <i>3) Solidworks Support</i> - Throughout the year, I also drafted various Solidworks drawings of components for internal team reference and external vendor specifications. I learned industry standards for technical drawings and applied them.<br>
            <b>Skills Used</b><br>
            Solidworks, metal fabrication, metal bending, power tool use, application of industry standards, design</p>

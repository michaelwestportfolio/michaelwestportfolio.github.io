        <p style="text-align: center;"><b>My Contributions:</b><br>
            The objective was to design, prototype, and fabricate a chassis and drive system within the constraints of the competition rules and the time frame set by the team. The chassis consisted of a custom-built frame made of 2”x1” aluminum stock and custom machined aluminum gussets. The drive system was powered by 4 Falcon 500 electric motors driving a gearbox containing a custom gear train. The motors powered all 6 wheels of the tank drive (2 via direct drive and 4 via chain drive). Noticeable improvements I made over the previous year include an outer bar on the chassis to minimize damage from impacts, a new method of fastening the wheels to the axels to reduce the length of the axels by approximately 0.75” to allow more internal space for components, a new motor setup, and pneumatic tires instead of solid plastic tires to allow the robot to transverse more complex terrain and obstacles. With the exceptions of the gearbox plates and wheels themself, all design work was completed by me in Solidworks modeling software. I led the fabrication of the chassis and drive system and led one other student who aided me.<br>

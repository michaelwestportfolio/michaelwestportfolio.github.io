        <p style="text-align: center;"><b>My Contributions:</b><br>
            The objective was to design, prototype, and fabricate a chassis and drive system within the constraints of the competition rules and the time frame set by the team. The chassis consisted of a custom-built frame made of 2”x1” aluminum stock and custom machined aluminum gussets. The drive system was powered by 6 Mini CIM electric motors powering a gearbox containing a custom gear train. The motors powered all 6 wheels of the tank drive (2 via direct drive and 4 via chain drive). With the exceptions of the gearbox plates and wheels themself, I did all the design work myself in Solidworks. I led the fabrication of the chassis and drive system and led two other students who aided me.<br>
            <br><b>Skills Used:</b><br>
            Solidworks, technical & organizational leadership, metal fabrication, power tool use, design</p>

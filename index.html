    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p style="text-align: center;">I am a 3rd year Aerospace Engineering honors student at the University of California, Irvine. I'm currently a student Aerodynamics Design Engineer on Anteater Formula Racing, UCI's FSAE team. My work for the team centers on the design of aerodynamics devices, wind tunnel testing, computation fluid dynamics (CFD), and prototyping. I am skilled in various engineering software including Solidworks (2D & 3D), Ansys Workbench (geometry defining & meshing), Ansys Fluent (2D & 3D), and MATLAB for data analysis and computational engineering. This portfolio contains various projects I have led or been integral to since beginning in the field of engineering and design 5 years ago. Please click on my projects below to read technical details and see images of my process.</p>

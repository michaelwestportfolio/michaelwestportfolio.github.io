        <p style="text-align: center;"><b>My Contributions:</b><br>
          I used Ansys Fluent to design and carry out simulations on rear wing geometries to calculate the aerodynamic efficiency of each geometry under consideration. After thorough white paper literature review and an analysis of the team's previous design, I selected different angles of attack and slot gaps for the three element rear wing. Using Solidworks, I created a 2D surface of each geometry to import into Ansys. I handled the meshing of the geometry, ensuring that the computational domain accurately represented conditions the wing may face while also balancing limited computational resources. Finally, I conducted the CFD simulation in the Fluent environment to calculate the downforce and drag forces of each combination to later compare the aerodynamic efficiencies of each. Throughout this project, I collaborated with other members to ensure proper integration and to aid them in reaching a final design.<br><br>
            I am currently in the process of working with other aerodynamics members to design and carry out wind tunnel testing on a subsonic horizontal wind tunnel. The results will be used for validating the Fluent results and comparing various airfoils.<br>
